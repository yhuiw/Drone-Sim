## How to use
Below control methods are developed for the simulation: LQR \(w/ & w/o Luenberger observer\), H inifinity, reinforcement learning using VPG as well as a simplified PID in Simulink. For the RL policy's visualization, run `vpg_quadrotor.py` first to have a weight file first.

Specs are tuned for the small drone net weight of 536g. Please retune if apply to other cases.
